## A Brainfuck Interpreter
### What is this?
A brainfuck interpreter. I wrote it in about an hour, it's not particularly performant or anything but (to my knowledge) it is fully functional and was a fun little project!
### Details
32K of memory, 8-bit memory cells, probably will segfault if you feed it an invalid program.
### How to Build
```bash
make
```
### Usage
```bash
./brainfuck <file.bf>
```
